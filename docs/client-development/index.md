**RD / CD / CS review**

On Thursdays every 2 weeks at 14:30

Optional meeting

Goal: the RD and CD teams will present the new features/improvements developed during the past sprint to the CS team.

A Google Doc has been created (https://docs.google.com/document/d/11oJ0h7V1qBL2xdBlCJ_UCzw61LgvIKtE18fEcRpK4aY/edit#heading=h.7j35c0hb073c) where the RD and CD developers who want to present something can announce it, in a very short description and the CS team can write questions and add some inputs if they have checked/tested the app on the test server.
