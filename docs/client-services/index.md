**R&D / CS review**

On Thursdays every 2 weeks at 14:30

Optional meeting


Goal: the R&D will present the new features the R&D team developed during the past sprint to you.

A Google Doc has been created (https://docs.google.com/document/d/11oJ0h7V1qBL2xdBlCJ_UCzw61LgvIKtE18fEcRpK4aY/edit#heading=h.7j35c0hb073c) where the R&D developers who want to present something can announce it, in a very short description and the CS team can write questions and add some inputs if they have checked/tested the app on the test server.
